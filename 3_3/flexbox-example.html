                    The African Savanna (Bush) elephant is the world's largest
                    land animal – with adult males, or bull elephants, standing
                    up to 3m high and weighing up to 6,000kg on average. Males
                    only reach their full size at 35-40 years - that’s well over
                    half their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to
                    60-70 years.

                <p>
                    Tigers have soft toe pads which help them walk silently
                    through their habitat. A tiger will typically travel 6-12
                    miles during a night’s hunting. During the day, a tiger’s
                    stripes can act as camouflage, allowing it to blend in with
                    its surroundings for stalking and ambushing its prey.

                <p>
                    Fascinatingly, hippos can identify a friend from foe by
                    smelling their dung – or poop! Hippos use middens, or
                    outdoor areas where they repeatedly go to the bathroom.
                    Hippos can then sniff the area to find out who’s been there,
                    and if they’re considered a friend.
